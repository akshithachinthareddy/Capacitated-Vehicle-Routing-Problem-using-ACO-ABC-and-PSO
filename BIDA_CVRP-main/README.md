# **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem using ACO, ABC, and PSO**

This project applies three powerful optimization algorithms - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) - to solve the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The CVRP is a classic optimization challenge that involves finding the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver to a given set of customers, subject to the capacity constraints of the vehicles.

## **Description**

The CVRP is crucial in logistics and supply chain management. This project demonstrates how ACO, ABC, and PSO can be applied to find efficient solutions. Each algorithm brings a unique approach to the problem, leveraging natural processes to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): Mimics the behavior of ants finding paths to food sources.
Artificial Bee Colony (ABC): Inspired by the foraging behavior of honey bees.
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): Models social behavior seen in bird flocking or fish schooling.
